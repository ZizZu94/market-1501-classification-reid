# [Deep Learning] Final assignment

This repo contains 3 Google colab notebooks:

- `1_classification_dl_project.ipynb` for the first task, this nothebook solves the attributes prediction problem.
- `2_1_reID_with_classification_model_dl_project.ipynb` contains a very simple solution for the second task, reID. Here we use the classification model (first task) to solve the reID task.
- `2_2_reID_dl_project.ipynb` contains the triplet loss based solution for the reID task.

Note: please maintain the notebook order to better undertand our proposed solutions.
